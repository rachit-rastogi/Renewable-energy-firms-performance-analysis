This study aims to identify the trend in the financial performance of renewable energy companies and to outline the renewable energy policies impacting their performance. The study is conducted on major renewable energy companies of India and US for the study period of 2015-2019. The financial performance of these companies is analyzed by using return on equity (ROE) decomposition and the trend in their performance is identified by utilizing k-means cluster of machine learning algorithm. Based on their ROE performance, five clusters are formed for Indian companies and four for US companies. It is observed that the performance of the companies in the renewable sector is heavily influenced by the government policies and for these companies to succeed, it is important that the government sets out policies which motivate these companies to invest more for clean energy development.
